    <h1>Aaron Charlton, PhD, MBA<br>Assistant Professor of Marketing at Illinois State University</h1>

    <p>I teach marketing research and marketing communications. Students in my classes work with real-world clients in order to gain hands-on experience. There was no book for this sort of thing so I wrote the book (and it's free): <a href="https://leanpub.com/realworldclients" target="_blank"><i>Real World Clients: A Guide for Student Consultants</i></a>.</p>
      
    <p>My research is focused on understanding and improving the practice of scientific research within the field of marketing. I run the <a href="https://www.metamarklab.com" target="_blank">Metascience & Marketing Lab</a> at ISU and I created <a href="https://www.openmktg.org/" target="_blank">OpenMKTG.org</a>, a website aimed at increasing transparency and quality in marketing science.</p>
    
    <p>You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVgEztrXpLfa72Gt7hzgLXKMLxmUd301aH2teXhWiuY/export?format=pdf">download my CV</a> to learn more about my work.</p>
